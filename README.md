This project aims to understand the working of EDR Tool. This repository is inspired from the original works done in this [repository](https://github.com/VajraSecurity/vajra-client).

## Steps to setup the Vajra Client

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PechimuthuMithil/CS433_Project
```
2. Ensure that the DNS resoultion for the server is successful. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
dig sudoDNS.iitgn.ac.in
```
This sudo has to be pronounced as pseudo (:]).

3. For Windows operating system, go to the windows directory of the repository and run Vajra_install.bat as admininstrator.

4. For Linux operating system, go to the linux directory of the repository and run Vajra_install.sh as sudo.
```bash
sudo ./Vajra_install.sh
```
5. The Vajra client is now installed and running the system. Ypu should be able to see the server IP you are connected to.
